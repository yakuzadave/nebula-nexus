    "# Working with Memgraph and Obsidian for Knowledge Graphs and RAG (Powered by LangChain)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Memgraph and Obsidian for Knowledge Graphs and RAG (Powered by LangChain).  This is a work in progress and highly experimental, so the code you see here is subject to change as I refine (and sometimes on a whim when I want to try something new).  The goal is to create a seamless integration between Memgraph and Obsidian for creating and querying knowledge graphs.  The integration is powered by LangChain, which will be adding additional functionality with LLMs such as GPT-4o, Llama-3, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Memgraph?\n",
    "Memgraph is a high-performance, in-memory graph database that is designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to use.  It is a great tool for creating and querying knowledge graphs.  You can learn more about Memgraph at [https://memgraph.com/](https://memgraph.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Obsidian?\n",
    "Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management tool that allows you to create and organize your notes, ideas, and knowledge in a graph-like structure.  It is a great tool for creating and visualizing knowledge graphs.  You can learn more about Obsidian at [https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LangChain?\n",
    "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language) and [components](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/). Hit the ground running using [third-party integrations(https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/platforms/)] and [Templates](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/templates/).\n",
    "- **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.\n",
    "- Deployment: Turn any chain into an API with [LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/langserve/).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/svg/langchain_stack_dark.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **langchain-core**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.\n",
    "- **langchain-community**: Third party integrations.\n",
    "  - Partner packages (e.g. **langchain-openai**, **langchain-anthropic**, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on langchain-core.\n",
    "- langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.\n",
    "- langgraph: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.\n",
    "- langserve: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.\n",
    "- LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications."
